FHIR stands for Fast Health Interoperability Standards and it is a standard for interoperability released by HL7 aka to exchange data.
In FHIR health data is represented as resources and exchanged through multiple paradigms, one of which is a RESTful server.

CQL was initially developed as a quality indicator in US, outside of HL7 standards but soon was incorporated into HL7. Identifying quality indicators involved into something that can be used for healthcare decision support. In US there are a lot of defined sets of computable knowledge associated with CQL but are not part of it yet, around conditions and procedures that the US uses for monitoring. 
We can develop those phenotypes and use them for decision support purposes rather than quality control purposes.
