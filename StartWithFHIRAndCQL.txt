This file explains how to use and configure Dataphoria CQL engine and some basics on the FHIR HAPI public server. 
It also includes useful resources and links.

FHIR stands for Fast Health Interoperability Standards and it is a standard for interoperability released by HL7 aka to exchange data.
In FHIR health data is represented as resources and exchanged through multiple paradigms, one of which is a RESTful server.

CQL was initially developed as a quality indicator in US, outside of HL7 standards but soon was incorporated into HL7. 
Identifying quality indicators involved into something that can be used for healthcare decision support. 
In US there are a lot of defined sets of computable knowledge associated with CQL but are not part of it yet, around conditions and procedures that the US uses for monitoring. 
We can develop those phenotypes and use them for decision support purposes rather than quality control purposes.



If you want to use Dataphoria CQL runner please follow:
Go to: 
https://cql-runner.dataphoria.org/
This is the CQL runner engine that is freely available to use.

Go to Config button and type:
Patient Id: 5342998 (feel free to use any other patient ID)
Source Data > Data Source URL: http://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4

Leave the rest of the settings untouched. However, just in case something gets broken here are the correct settings (to date)
CQL engine: https://cloud.alphora.com/sandbox/r4/cqm/fhir/$cql
Terminology service: https://cloud.alphora.com/sandbox/r4/cqm/fhir
Library repository: https://cloud.alphora.com/sandbox/r4/cqm/fhir
The rest of the fields leave blank.



The server we use is the FHIR Hapi public server. link: https://hapi.fhir.org/home?serverId=home_r4&pretty=true&_summary=&resource=
